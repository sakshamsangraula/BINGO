# BINGO

In this project, a 5x5 game board is created and it is filled with randomly generated unique odd numbers. Then, the playBingo() method generates new random unique odd numbers and if that number already exists in the game board then it is replaced with a zero and now that same number cannot be used(a completely new random odd number is needed to proceed). If there is a series of zeros in a row or a column, or a diagonal (from left to right or right to left) then you win the game!
